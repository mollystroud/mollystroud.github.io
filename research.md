Clean water is vital for life on Earth, but humans are drastically altering water quality in our rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Activities such as deforestation, dam building, and urbanization can greatly impair water quality, causing harm to plant and animal ecosystems and human communities on a global scale.

Satellite remote sensing offers a unique perspective into the extent and rates at which we are altering Earth's water. Using satellites, we can track the quantity of water moving across Earth's surface as well as various aspects of water quality, including sediment load, algae, and water temperature.

My research interests concern how we can use satellite remote sensing in novel and innovative ways.
